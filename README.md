# ProtractorSandbox

To run the tests, in a command window, type:<br>
<b>protractor conf.js</b>

This assumes that
<ol>
  <li> you have a file conf.js in the current directory, </li>
  <li> for anything to happen, that conf.js references a spec2.js (right now) </li>
</ol>

A quick way of running up an http server for testing/playing is:
<pre>
npm install http-server -g
http-server
</pre>
